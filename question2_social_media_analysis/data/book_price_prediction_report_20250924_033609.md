## 1. Linear Regression Analysis: Price Prediction from Ratings

### Model Performance

- **Model Equation:** `price = -0.93 √ó rating + 50.98`
- **R-squared:** 0.0058
- **Dataset Size:** 20 books
- **Rating Range:** 1.0 - 5.0
- **Price Range:** $17.77 - $72.71

### Interpretation
‚ùå Rating has virtually no predictive power for price

The model explains 0.6% of the variance in book prices.

### Sample Predictions

| 1 | $50.05 |
| 2 | $49.11 |
| 3 | $48.18 |
| 4 | $47.25 |
