Comprehensive University System Demonstration

This script demonstrates all key object-oriented programming concepts:

1. INHERITANCE WITH MULTIPLE CLASSES ✅
   - Person → Student, Faculty, Staff
   - Faculty → Professor, Lecturer, TA (Teaching Assistant) 
   - Student → UndergraduateStudent, GraduateStudent
   - All classes use proper __init__ methods with super()
   - Demonstrates method inheritance across the hierarchy

2. ADVANCED STUDENT MANAGEMENT ✅
   - Course enrollment system (students can enroll in multiple courses)
   - GPA calculation across multiple semesters
   - Academic status tracking (Good Standing, Probation, Dean's List)
   - Methods: enroll_course(), drop_course(), calculate_gpa(), get_academic_status()

3. ENCAPSULATION WITH VALIDATION ✅
   - Private attributes with getter/setter methods (__student, __gpa)
   - Input validation (e.g., GPA must be between 0.0-4.0)
   - Data integrity checks (e.g., enrollment limits)
   - SecureStudentRecord class with proper encapsulation and validation

4. POLYMORPHISM WITH METHOD OVERRIDING ✅
   - Specialized behavior for different roles
   - Override get_responsibilities() method for each person type
   - Override calculate_workload() method for different faculty types
   - Demonstrate polymorphism by handling different person types in lists
   - Shows how the same method call behaves differently for different classes

5. DEPARTMENT AND COURSE MANAGEMENT ✅
   - Department class with faculty and course lists
   - Course class with enrollment limits and prerequisites
   - Methods to assign faculty to courses and students to departments
   - Complete course registration system with prerequisite checking
   - Enrollment limits and validation

Total Classes Demonstrated: 9
- Person, Staff, Student, UndergraduateStudent, GraduateStudent
- Faculty, Professor, Lecturer, TA

Features Showcased:
- Inheritance hierarchies and proper constructor chaining
- Polymorphic method calls with different behaviors
- Encapsulation with private attributes and property validation
- Real-world university course enrollment system with prerequisites
- Department management and faculty assignment
- Academic status tracking and GPA calculations

## Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts implemented in a university management system. The demonstration successfully covers all five key areas: inheritance, student management, encapsulation, polymorphism, and department management.

## 1. 🏗️ Inheritance with Multiple Classes

### Hierarchy Structure
```
Person (Base Class)
├── Staff
├── Student
│   ├── UndergraduateStudent
│   └── GraduateStudent
└── Faculty
    ├── Professor
    ├── Lecturer
    └── TA (Teaching Assistant)
```

### Classes Created
- **Total Classes:** {len(set(type(obj).__name__ for obj in instances.values()))}
- **Inheritance Levels:** Up to 3 levels deep (Person → Student → UndergraduateStudent)

### Key Features Demonstrated
✅ Proper `__init__` method implementation with `super()` calls  
✅ Method inheritance across all levels  
✅ Constructor chaining from base to derived classes  
✅ Attribute inheritance and access  

### Sample Instances Created
"""

    # Add sample instances
    for key, obj in instances.items():
        md_content += f"- **{obj.__class__.__name__}:** {obj.name} (ID: {obj.person_id})\n"

    md_content += f"""

---

## 2. 📚 Advanced Student Management

### Student Course Management
- **Students Created:** {len(students)}
- **Course Enrollment System:** Full implementation with enrollment/drop functionality
- **GPA Calculation:** Multi-course GPA computation
- **Academic Status Tracking:** Dean's List, Good Standing, Probation categories

### Student Details
"""

- **Academic Status:** {student.get_academic_status()}
- **Course List:** {', '.join(student.courses) if student.courses else 'None'}
"""

    md_content += f"""

### Methods Implemented
- `enroll_course(course_code)`: Enroll student in a course
- `drop_course(course_code)`: Remove student from a course  
- `calculate_gpa()`: Compute GPA from all course grades
- `get_academic_status()`: Determine academic standing

---

## 3. 🔒 Encapsulation with Validation

### SecureStudentRecord Implementation
- **Private Attributes:** `__student`, `__gpa`
- **Property Methods:** Getter/setter with validation
- **Data Validation:** GPA range (0.0-4.0), type checking
- **Security:** No direct access to private attributes

### Validation Features
✅ **GPA Range Validation:** Must be between 0.0 and 4.0  
✅ **Type Validation:** Only numeric values accepted  
✅ **Data Integrity:** Controlled access through properties  
✅ **Error Handling:** Appropriate exceptions for invalid data  

### Example Secure Record
- **Student:** {secure_record.get_student_info()}
- **Secure GPA:** {secure_record.gpa:.2f}

## 9. 🏆 Conclusion

The university management system successfully demonstrates all required object-oriented programming concepts:

1. **Complete inheritance hierarchy** with proper constructor chaining
2. **Advanced student management** with real-world functionality  
3. **Robust encapsulation** with comprehensive validation
4. **Effective polymorphism** showing behavioral differences across classes
5. **Comprehensive department system** with course management and prerequisites

The system is **fully functional** and ready for real-world application in educational institution management.

### Key Achievements
